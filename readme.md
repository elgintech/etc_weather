# ETC Weather App

## Used for Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth's visit to ETC on April 16, 2014

This is a simple app that uses jQuery to pull weather information for a given zip code.  It utilizes [simpleWeather jQuery plugin](http://simpleweatherjs.com) to pull weather data from Yahoo's API.  Thanks to <http://codepen.io/kyraoja/pen/Ctkjc> for the code example used as a reference.
